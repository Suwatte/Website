The Open Publication Distribution System or OPDS is a catalog format that enables the aggregation, distribution, discovery, and acquisition of electronic publications. Suwatte allows you to add OPDS Servers to your library. To do this navigate to Library > Local > OPDS, and tap the Plus icon. Here you'll be presented a form to setup the server. 

Once added, you'll be able to stream or download your comics directly to your device.
